ðŸ§  SmartGov â€“ Helping People Find the Right Government Schemes
A lot of people, especially in rural or underprivileged areas, donâ€™t know about the government schemes theyâ€™re eligible for. Itâ€™s not that these schemes donâ€™t existâ€”the information just doesnâ€™t reach the right people. Whether it's because of language barriers, lack of digital knowledge, or just the complexity of the system, people miss out on benefits they deserve.

SmartGov is an idea that uses AI to solve this problem. Think of it as a smart assistant that understands your situationâ€”your income, education level, where you live, even your caste or category if you want to shareâ€”and then tells you exactly which schemes youâ€™re eligible for.

But weâ€™re not stopping there.

We also use AI language models to explain the schemes to you in your local languageâ€”whether itâ€™s Hindi, Bhojpuri, Tamil, or any other.

And to make the system trustworthy, we can log the awareness or interaction on blockchainâ€”so thereâ€™s a secure, transparent record that you saw or applied for something.

Government bodies also get a dashboard to see which areas are aware, where people are benefiting, and where things need improvement.

This is not just a website. Itâ€™s a movement to inform and empower people with personalized, understandable, and trustworthy information about whatâ€™s already available to help them.

Imagine a farmer getting to know, in Bhojpuri, that there's a subsidy for solar pumps. Or a single mother in a small town learning about a free skill training program for women. Thatâ€™s the real impact weâ€™re aiming for.
